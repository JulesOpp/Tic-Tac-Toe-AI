Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
==============
Author: Julius Oppenheim

I tried to keep the main file in everything under 100 lines for this.
I call it the 100-line Challenge.

The program is a basic example of Tic-Tac-Toe.
I have included two file, one is a console version of the game and the other is an iPhone App for the game.
The iPhone App is probably more recent, has more functionality, and a stronger AI.

The AI for the console is simple. It recognizes if it can win in a move or if it needs to 
defend against a loss (two in a row of any kind).
If there are no two of a kinds, then it chooses a random location.

The AI for the iPhone is slightly more complex.
It can recognize certain situations where the user tries to fork.
It is VERY difficult to beat this AI.

The iPhone version lets you select between a one player and two player mode for the game.

The interface is rather ugly, sorry about that.
